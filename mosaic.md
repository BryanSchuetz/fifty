    <p>When you ask DAI staff why they come to DAI, why they stay, and what they love about it, the answer is remarkably consistent: itâ€™s the work we do and the people we do it with. Here are roughly a thousand of those people, or roughly a fifth of the DAI team at work around the world. Many faces, One DAI.</p>
